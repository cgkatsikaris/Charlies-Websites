        <h1>Charlies Resume!</h1>
        
        <p>I play a lot of baksetball and I was on the junior varsity team this year as a sophomore. I have also worked at my dads store and have some great experience stocking shelves.</p>
        

        <p>My grades this year were pretty good considering I got three A's and two B's in all my C1 classes.</p>
